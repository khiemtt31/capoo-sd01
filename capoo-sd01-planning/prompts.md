### General Prompts
## Baselines
# Version 1.0 - Initial Phase
I’m using Roo Code for a project management application that includes core features like user management, project tracking, progress monitoring, notifications, and tagging.
I need AI-generated content that helps with:

1. Business Requirements — Build a whole User Story Line from the beginning to ending.
2. Sprint planning — including breaking down features into sprints.
3. Effort estimation — calculating story points based on detailed functionality.
4. Coding standards — defining consistent coding rules aligned with the chosen technology stack.

Focus only on these objectives. Do not include unrelated suggestions or add extra project scope. Start step by step, current is Business Requirements from scratch.
