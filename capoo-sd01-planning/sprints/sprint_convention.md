# Sprint Convention and Structure

This document outlines the conventions for sprint planning, file naming, and content structure for the Roo Code Project Management Application.

## 1. Sprint Phases

Each sprint progresses through three distinct phases, indicated in the filename:

*   **[NEW]:** The sprint is planned but has not yet started. This is the initial state for a new sprint plan.
*   **[PENDING]:** The sprint is currently active and in progress. The team is actively working on the user stories defined within it.
*   **[COMPLETED]:** The sprint is finished. All tasks have been completed and verified. Once a sprint is marked as completed, it is considered closed, and no further changes are made to it.

## 2. File Naming Convention

Sprint documents must follow a strict naming convention to ensure consistency and clarity:

`sprint_{sprint_number}_[{status}].md`

*   **sprint_number:** A two-digit identifier for the sprint (e.g., 01, 02, 03).
*   **status:** The current phase of the sprint (`NEW`, `PENDING`, or `COMPLETED`).

**Example:** `sprint_01_[NEW].md`

## 3. Sprint Content Structure

Each user story within a sprint document must be detailed using the following structure. This ensures that all necessary information for development is captured clearly and consistently.
